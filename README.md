## What is this repository for? ##

The IObundle Programmable Finite State Machine (FSM) is a RISC-V-based Peripheral written in Verilog, which users can download, modify, simulate and implement in FPGA or ASIC.
This IP core uses a wall clock timer to trigger events based on the time. It provides an interface for the system that can be stimulated according to the IOs status and precise timings.
