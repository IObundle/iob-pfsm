# IOb PFSM Linux Kernel Drivers
- Structure:
    - `drivers/`: directory with linux kernel module drivers for iob_pfsm
        - `iob_pfsm_main.c`: driver source
        - `[iob_pfsm.h]` and `[iob_pfsm_sysfs.h]`: header files generated by:
        ```bash
        python3 .path/to/iob-linux/scripts/drivers.py iob_pfsm -o [output_dir]
        ```
        - `driver.mk`: makefile segment with `iob_pfsm-obj:` target for driver
          compilation
    - `iob_pfsm.dts`: device tree template with iob_pfsm node
        - manually add the `pfsm` node to the system device tree so the
          iob_pfsm is recognized by the linux kernel
